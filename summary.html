<p>To address going off the board I used an if statement to check where the snake was relative to the board size and if it surpassed the boundaries I had it alert and stop the game while also doing a reset of the startButton text value and also changing the paragraph text content.
</p>

<p>To address the snake head/tail colors I just used the canvas fill based on what was in the starter code and set it up to change just the head and then cycle through to the final location before null to change the tail color.</p>

<p>Most of the problems I had were finding the best spot to remove the eventListener on the Start button. I was getting some buggy restarts and couldn't figure out if it was in the code or the browser but I believe i've figured it out. But while testing again I did break it somehow but I can't replicate it so I don't know if it's certain browsers on my machine that have settings that aren't good or if it's some other item. It seems to work as intended now and I can't replicate the problem so maybe it's just certain browsers in rare situations.</p>

<p>To make sure food didn't spawn inside the snake body I cycle through and compare the desired food location and if it matched anywhere in the snake body then to run the function again to find a new location.</p>
